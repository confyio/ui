        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <div>
          <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
          <p>Like most website operators, Confy collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Confy’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Confy’s visitors use its website.</p>
          <p>Confy also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Confy does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Voluntary information</h3>
          <p>Certain visitors to Confy’s websites choose to interact with Confy in ways that require Confy to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Confy gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Confy collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Confy. Confy does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Protection of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
          <p>Confy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that</p>

          <ul>
            <li>need to know that information in order to process it on Confy’s behalf or to provide services available at Confy’s websites, and</li>
            <li>that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home country; by using Confy’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
          <p>Confy will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p>
          <p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above, Confy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Confy believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Confy, third parties or the public at large.</p>
          <p>Confy takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

          <p>If you are a registered user of an Confy website and have supplied your email address, Confy may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Confy and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.</p>

          <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Confy uses cookies to help Confy identify and track visitors, their usage of Confy website, and their website access preferences. Confy visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Confy’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Confy’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

          <h3>Advertising Partners</h3>
          <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Confy and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
