        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>3. Service Policies and Privacy</h3>
          <p><span className="marked">3.1.</span> The Service shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Service available at <a href="https://confy.io/#privacy">https://confy.io/#privacy</a> (or such URL as Confy may provide), which references and incorporates Confy's privacy policy available at <a href="https://confy.io/#privacy">https://confy.io/#privacy</a>. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Confy's privacy policies.</p>
          <p><span className="marked">3.2.</span> You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the users of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. To do so, at a minimum, you must incorporate the privacy terms available at <a href="https://confy.io/#privacy">https://confy.io/#privacy</a> into the privacy policy for your application. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to Confy.</p>
          <p><span className="marked">3.3.</span> If the user provides you with Confy Account information, you may only use that information to access the user's Confy Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>4. Fees for Use of the Service</h3>
          <p><span className="marked">4.1.</span> Subject to the Terms, the Service is provided to you with charge up to certain quotas. These quotas will be known as the "Fee Threshold" and can be found <a href="https://confy.io/#pricing">here</a>.</p>
          <p><span className="marked">4.2.</span> A bill will be issued to your online account for all charges accrued in excess of the Fee Threshold. For use of the Service in excess of any portion of the Fee Threshold, you shall be responsible for all charges up to the amount set in your online account, and shall pay all charges in U.S. Dollars or in such other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Confy incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Confy's measurements of your use of the Service, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Confy and only in the form of credit for the Service. Nothing in these Terms obligates Confy to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Confy may be shared by Confy with companies who work on Confy's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Confy and servicing your account. Confy may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Confy shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Confy reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Service to you for any late payments.</p>
          <p><span className="marked">4.3.</span> Confy may change its fees and payment policies for the Service with ninety (90) days prior notice. However, Confy may change the Fee Threshold limits at its discretion. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the payments page or at <a href="https://confy.io/#tos">https://confy.io/#tos</a> (or such other URL Confy may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.</p>
          <p><span className="marked">4.4.</span> You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Service in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.</p>

          <h3>10. Modification and Termination of the Service</h3>
          <p><span className="marked">10.1.</span> Confy is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Service which Confy provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you, subject to the terms in Sections 4.3 and 10.2. Changes to the form and nature of the Service will be effective with respect to all versions of the Service (including the Deprecated Version of the Service); examples of changes to the form and nature of the Service include without limitation changes to fee and payment policies, security patches, added functionality, and other enhancements.</p>

          <p><span className="marked">10.2.</span> If Confy in its discretion chooses to cease providing the current version of the Service whether through discontinuation of the Service or by upgrading the Service to a newer version, the current version of the Service will be deprecated and become the Deprecated Version of the Service. Confy will issue an announcement if the current version of the Service will be deprecated. For a period of 3 years after an announcement (the “Deprecation Period”), Confy will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate the Deprecated Version of the Service and to respond to problems with the Deprecated Version of the Service deemed by Confy in its discretion to be critical. During the Deprecation Period, no new features will be added to the Deprecated Version of the Service.</p>
          <p>Confy reserves the right in its discretion to cease providing all or any part of the Deprecated Version of the Service immediately without any notice if:</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(A)</span> you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner that clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(B)</span> Confy is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the law governing the provision of the Deprecated Version of the Service); or</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(C)</span> the Deprecated Version of the Service relies on data or services provided by a third party partner and the relationship with such partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires Confy to change the way Confy provides the data or services through the Deprecated Version of the Service; or</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(D)</span> providing the Deprecated Version of the Service could create a substantial economic burden as determined by Confy in its reasonable good faith judgment; or</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(E)</span> providing the Deprecated Version of the Service could create a security risk or material technical burden as determined by Confy in its reasonable good faith judgment.</p>

This Section 10.2 of the Terms will not apply to any features or functionality labeled as "experimental."</p>
          <p>This Section 10.2 of the Terms also will not apply to the Confy Software (as defined in Section 7.1).</p>

          <p><span className="marked">10.3.</span> You may discontinue your use of the Service at any time. Confy may, at any time, terminate your use of the Service if:</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(A)</span> you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner that clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(B)</span> Confy is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the law governing the provision of the Service); or</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(C)</span> the Service relies on data or services provided by a third party partner and the relationship with such partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires Confy to change the way Confy provides the data or services through the Service; or</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(D)</span> providing the Service could create a substantial economic burden as determined by Confy in its reasonable good faith judgment; or</p>
          <p><span className="marked">(E)</span> providing the Service could create a security risk or material technical burden as determined by Confy in its reasonable good faith judgment.</p>

          <p><span className="marked">10.4.</span> Upon any termination of the Service under Sections 4 or 10 , these Terms will also terminate, but Sections 6.1, 11, 12, 13, and 17 shall continue to be effective after these Terms are terminated.</p>
